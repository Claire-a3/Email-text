    <p>Hello participant,</p>

    <p>Thank you for taking part in the Karakana Program pitch competition.</p>

    <p>
      We are pleased to read and hear about your exceptional journey and great
      strides in your work. We had the honor of listening to multiple diverse
      and interesting presentations and are quite impressed by the amazing work
      you do. While we are thrilled by your succes, we regret to inform you that
      your pitch was not successful at this time.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, this is not a reflection on your capacity but a limitation on our
      programs ability to help you in the growth that you seek and as such, we
      hope that you will continue pursuing your goals and grow your capacity for
      long-term development of your project.
    </p>

    <p>
      We would like to provide an extension for you to continue engaging with us
      through our public forums as a way to continue building on the shared
      goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you and we wish you the best in your continued spirited and
      productive work.
    </p>
    <p>With regards,</p>

    <p>Kiwanda Team.</p>
